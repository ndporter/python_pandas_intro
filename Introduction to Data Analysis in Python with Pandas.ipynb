If p is less than a given value (usually 0.05), there is a statistically significant difference between the groups; e.g. they're not random samples drawn from the same population. Remember there is still a 1 in 20 probability that you're wrong, but if the test value p is decreased, we then increase the probability of not finding a difference even when there is a true difference.\n",
    "- The third value is the degrees of freedom for the test, which is based on the number of cases. More cases provide more degrees of freedom, which allows for more statistical confidence even with the same differences in means. This is why you can't just ask the three people next to you which band is better and assume that more people in the US (or even the class) prefer whichever two of the three of them say.\n",

If p is less than a given value (usually 0.05), there is a statistically significant relationship between the variables; e.g. one is not randomly distributed across the other. Remember there is still a 1 in 20 probability that you're wrong, but if the test value p is decreased, we then increase the probability of not finding a relationship even when there is a true relationship.\n",
