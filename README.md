# Introduction to Data Analysis with Python and Pandas (VT University Libraries)
Material for Python and Pandas workshop by Virginia Tech University Libraries

There are two versions of the Jupyter notebook in this repository. The full version includes instruction in base Python and is designed for a 3-hour workshop taught to people with computational skills who may be total Python novices. The "no base Python" version contains a subset of the material suitable for a 2-hour Pandas workshop for learners who already know basic Python equivalent to the topics covered in episodes 1-8 of the Software Carpentry [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) workshop.
